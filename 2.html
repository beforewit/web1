    <h2>Lululemon</h2>

    lululemon makes technical athletic clothes for yoga, running, working out, and most other sweaty pursuits. As always, shipping is free.

    Lululemon changed the prices of its iconic women's yoga leggings recently â€” and customers are freaking out. They think the company is trying to sneak through an unjustified price increase.
Normally, this wouldn't be news. But this is Lululemon, the yoga brand that has created a cult-like customer following to match its cult-like company culture.
